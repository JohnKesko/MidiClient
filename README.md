## Midi client for macOS using CoreMIDI

### How to run?

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/JohnKesko/MidiClient.git
```

2. cd MidiClient
3. make
4. Play on your keyboard

This is the bare minimum to handle MIDI on macOS.
Because of that, we need to include both CoreMIDI and CoreFoundation during compilation.

See the makefile.
